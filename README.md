# BR Simple Carousel

A modern, lightweight, and responsive image showcase carousel for Joomla. Unlike traditional sliders, this module displays multiple images side-by-side in a professional showcase format. It is built with performance in mind using vanilla JavaScript and CSS (no jQuery or Bootstrap dependencies).



## 🚀 Features

* **Automatic Showcase**: Just select a folder inside `/images` and the carousel starts running automatically.
* **Multi-Item Display**: Choose to display between 1 to 6 images simultaneously on Desktop.
* **Mobile Ready**: Automatically switches to a single-image view on mobile devices for better visibility.
* **Performance First**: Uses `getBoundingClientRect` for precise sub-pixel navigation and hardware-accelerated CSS transitions.
* **Zero Dependencies**: Pure Vanilla JS and CSS—no library conflicts.
* **Highly Customizable**:
    * Set maximum width (centered) and fixed height.
    * Choose between **Cover** (fill) or **Contain** (fit) image modes.
    * Adjustable auto-play duration.
* **Modern Architecture**: Fully compatible with Joomla 5 and Joomla 6.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Download the latest `.zip` release.
2. In your Joomla Administrator, go to **System > Install > Extensions**.
3. Upload the package.
4. Go to **Content > Site Modules**, find **"BR Simple Carousel"**.
5. Select your image folder, set your display preferences, and publish it to a position.

## 📝 Configuration Tips

* **Folder Path**: Ensure your images are in a subdirectory of the Joomla `images/` folder.
* **Dimensions**: Use units like `px` or `%` (e.g., `1200px` for Max Width and `250px` for Height).
* **Gap**: The module features a built-in 15px gap between items to ensure a clean, modern aesthetic.
